In PC gaming specifically, 58% of all revenue ($24.4 billion) comes from microtransactions. Despite billions spent on digital items, players receive only temporary access rights without resale or transfer options.</p> </li> <li> <p>Community Control: Games-as-a-service models can result in sudden community loss when companies discontinue support. Recent examples include Dauntless (servers closed May 2025), MultiVersus (servers closed May 2025), and XDefiant (servers closed June 2025). When servers shut down, entire communities and years of player progress become inaccessible.</p> </li> <li> <p>Digital Rights: Despite spending billions on \"purchases,\" players receive revocable licenses rather than ownership. Digital storefronts operate under licensing models where access can be terminated at any time. Gaming accounts with accumulated progress and achievements cannot be transferred or sold, unlike physical games that could be resold or gifted. When Ubisoft delisted The Crew in 2024, existing licenses were revoked, making previously purchased games unplayable. California passed AB 2426 in 2024 requiring clearer disclosure about licensing versus ownership, reflecting how companies have systematically obscured these limitations.</p> </li> <li> <p>Creative Freedom: Revenue-focused development has shifted industry priorities toward proven monetization models. Game companies now have duties to shareholders to maximize revenue regardless of player satisfaction. Today's highest-grossing games prioritize engagement algorithms and spending triggers over innovative gameplay. Traditional game sales declined 2.6% in 2024 while microtransactions grew 1.4%, demonstrating this fundamental industry shift.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"#our-solution-community-empowerment","title":"Our Solution: Community Empowerment","text":"<p>Rather than accepting the industry's current direction, we're demonstrating that sustainable, community-centered gaming is not only possible but more resilient:</p> <p>What We're Building:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Genuine Stakeholder Communities: Players earn real influence through meaningful participation\u2014time invested, achievements earned, community contributions made.
