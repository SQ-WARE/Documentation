# SQWARE

**Community-Owned Gaming Platform** where your gameplay contributions earn you real ownership and governance power.

---

## What is SQWARE?

SQWARE is a **community-owned gaming platform** where players earn ownership stakes through gameplay and contribution. Think of it like earning shares in a company - the more you contribute, the more influence you have over platform decisions.

### How It Works

1. **Play & Contribute** - Earn Points through gameplay, achievements, and community participation
2. **Exchange for Ownership** - Convert Points to Tokens (like company shares) via off-game exchange
3. **Use Your Tokens** - Vote on decisions, purchase ranks/cosmetics, support creators, or buy merchandise

!!! note "Token Availability"
    **Governance Tokens are not yet available.** Currently, players earn Points through gameplay. Token exchange and governance features will be implemented in future updates.

## Core Principles

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-account-group:{ .lg .middle } **Player Ownership**

    ---

    Communities belong to the people who build them. Your contributions earn you real ownership stakes in the platform.

-   :material-vote:{ .lg .middle } **Democratic Governance**

    ---

    Token holders vote on platform decisions, development priorities, and community standards.

-   :material-shield-account:{ .lg .middle } **Merit-Based Recognition**

    ---

    Influence is earned through contribution, not financial investment. Your time and effort build lasting status.
