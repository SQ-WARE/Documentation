# SQWARE

*Where players become stakeholders. Where contribution creates ownership.*

---

## Core pillars

**SQWARE is a community‑owned gaming platform** where contribution turns into governance influence and platform benefits.

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-account-group:{ .lg .middle } **Player‑Owned Platforms**

    ---

    Communities belong to the people who build them. Contribution translates into voice and influence.

-   :material-vote:{ .lg .middle } **Governance Through Contribution**

    ---

    500 Tokens = 1 vote; 5,000 Tokens to propose changes. Tokens are for governance rights and platform use only.

-   :material-shield-account:{ .lg .middle } **True Digital Ownership**

    ---

    Your time and effort build lasting identity and status across the platform.

### How it works

- **Recognition (Points)** for hourly playtime, achievements, and community contribution  
  [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Recognition System](rewards.md)
- **Governance (Tokens)** when available via off‑game exchange; 500 Tokens = 1 vote; 5,000 to propose  
  [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Community Guidelines](servers/rules.md)
- **Compliance**: No tokens/blockchain in game clients; any exchange happens off‑server
