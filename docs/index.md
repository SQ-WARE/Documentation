# SQWARE

*Building the Future of Community-Owned Gaming*

**SQWARE represents a fundamental shift in how gaming communities operate.** We're creating platforms where players aren't just consumers, but genuine stakeholders with real influence over the games and communities they love.

---

## Our Vision

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-account-group:{ .lg .middle } **Player-Owned Platforms**

    ---

    Gaming communities should belong to the people who build them. Every hour spent playing, every achievement earned, every contribution made should translate into meaningful ownership and decision-making power within that community.

-   :material-shield-account:{ .lg .middle } **True Digital Ownership**

    ---

    Players invest countless hours building their digital lives, accounts, achievements, friendships, and communities. Yet traditional gaming gives them no real ownership or control over these investments. We're changing that.

-   :material-vote:{ .lg .middle } **Community Governance**

    ---

    The most passionate, dedicated community members should have the strongest voice in shaping their gaming experience. Our governance system ensures that those who contribute the most have the greatest influence.

## How SQWARE Works

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-star-circle:{ .lg .middle } **Merit-Based Recognition**

    ---

    Players earn recognition through genuine contribution - time investment, achievement milestones, community building, and creative contributions. Your dedication shapes your influence.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Learn About Our System](rewards.md)

-   :material-gavel:{ .lg .middle } **Governance Through Contribution**

    ---

    Recognition translates directly into governance power. With 500 SQ = 1 vote, participate in platform decisions, development direction, and community standards. Real influence for real contribution.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Community Guidelines](servers/rules.md)

-   :material-bitcoin:{ .lg .middle } **SQ Token Framework**

    ---

    On Minecraft servers, each hour played and achievements earn Points. Points may be convertible to SQ Tokens (a governance token) in the future once available. Some non-Minecraft games may award SQ Tokens directly. Tokens provide governance rights and community ownership, not speculation opportunities.

## Why This Matters

### **The Gaming Industry Crisis**

The gaming industry has undergone a massive transformation, with business models increasingly prioritizing revenue extraction over player experience:

**What We've Lost:**

- **Player Agency**: Microtransactions now dominate gaming revenue, generating $57.89 billion globally in 2024 and projected to reach $115 billion by 2034. In PC gaming specifically, 58% of all revenue ($24.4 billion) comes from microtransactions. Despite billions spent on digital items, players receive only temporary access rights without resale or transfer options.

- **Community Control**: Games-as-a-service models can result in sudden community loss when companies discontinue support. Recent examples include Dauntless (servers closed May 2025), MultiVersus (servers closed May 2025), and XDefiant (servers closed June 2025). When servers shut down, entire communities and years of player progress become inaccessible.

- **Digital Rights**: Despite spending billions on "purchases," players receive revocable licenses rather than ownership. Digital storefronts operate under licensing models where access can be terminated at any time. Gaming accounts with accumulated progress and achievements cannot be transferred or sold, unlike physical games that could be resold or gifted. When Ubisoft delisted The Crew in 2024, existing licenses were revoked, making previously purchased games unplayable. California passed AB 2426 in 2024 requiring clearer disclosure about licensing versus ownership, reflecting how companies have systematically obscured these limitations.

- **Creative Freedom**: Revenue-focused development has shifted industry priorities toward proven monetization models. Game companies now have duties to shareholders to maximize revenue regardless of player satisfaction. Today's highest-grossing games prioritize engagement algorithms and spending triggers over innovative gameplay. Traditional game sales declined 2.6% in 2024 while microtransactions grew 1.4%, demonstrating this fundamental industry shift.

### **Our Solution: Community Empowerment**

Rather than accepting the industry's current direction, we're demonstrating that sustainable, community-centered gaming is not only possible but more resilient:

**What We're Building:**

- **Genuine Stakeholder Communities**: Players earn real influence through meaningful participation—time invested, achievements earned, community contributions made. Our system rewards behaviors that strengthen the community itself rather than focusing primarily on spending-based metrics.

- **Merit-Based Governance**: Decision-making power scales with constructive contribution rather than financial spending. Our governance polls require 500 SQ per vote and 5,000 SQ to propose changes, ensuring those most invested in community health drive platform direction.

- **Transparent Development**: Community members directly influence development priorities through open governance processes. Our roadmap reflects actual player needs and community feedback, with significant changes debated and decided by the community they affect.

- **Sustainable Economics**: We build systems where community success and individual satisfaction naturally align. Our model demonstrates that gaming platforms can thrive financially while prioritizing player agency and community ownership alongside sustainable development practices.

## Compliance Note (Minecraft)

**No blockchain or token payouts in Minecraft**: No blockchain technology or SQ Tokens are rewarded directly from Minecraft servers or clients. On Minecraft, recognition is Points-only. Any future convertibility of Points to SQ Tokens would happen off-server and outside the Minecraft client.

## Beyond Gaming

**SQWARE represents more than just gaming reform**—it's a model for how digital communities can be truly owned and controlled by their participants.

    - **Decentralized community governance** that actually works
    - **Merit-based influence systems** that reward genuine contribution  
    - **Sustainable community economics** that serve participants over shareholders
    - **Digital spaces** where users have real ownership and control

### **The Future We're Building**

A world where digital communities belong to the people who create, maintain, and care about them. Where time and effort spent building something meaningful translates into real ownership and influence.
