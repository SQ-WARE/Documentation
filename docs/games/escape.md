## Game Overview

ESCAPE is a **multiplayer loot extraction shooter** where every decision could mean the difference between walking away rich or losing everything you brought.

### The Core Loop

1. **Deploy** - Enter a shared map with other players, bringing your own gear
2. **Scavenge** - Search for weapons, consumables, and rare items scattered across the map
3. **Decide** - Push deeper for better loot or head to extraction to secure what you've found
4. **Extract** - Reach extraction zones and survive the timer to bank your inventory
5. **Consequences** - Die and lose everything you brought AND found
6. **Progress** - Grow your stash, improve loadouts, unlock crafting between raids

This creates tension: every decision trades risk for potential reward.
