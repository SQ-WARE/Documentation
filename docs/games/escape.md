## What is an extraction shooter?

Extraction shooters are session-based games focused on high-stakes risk and reward.

- **Deploy**: Enter a shared map with other players.
- **Scavenge**: Search for weapons, consumables, and rare items.
- **Decide**: Push deeper for better loot or head to an extraction point to bank what youâ€™ve found.
- **Extract**: Reach extraction zones and survive the timer to secure your inventory.
- **Consequences**: If you die, you lose what you brought and what you found during the run.
- **Meta progression**: Grow your stash, improve loadouts, unlock crafting, traders, and quests between raids.

This loop creates meaningful tension: every decision trades risk for potential reward.

## Core pillars

- **Tactical PvPvE**: Read audio/visual cues, manage recoil and resources, and adapt to threats.
- **Economy that matters**: Items have practical value; scarcity and loadout choices impact each raid.
- **Persistent progression**: Account-level stash, reputation, and crafting systems survive between sessions.
- **Fair competitive design**: No pay-to-win. Skill, knowledge, and teamwork drive success.
