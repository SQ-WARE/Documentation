# SQWARE Community Platform

*Experience community ownership and merit‑based governance in action.*

---

## What this is

**This is our live community platform.** Your playtime, achievements, and community contributions earn Points that build your governance influence.

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-vote:{ .lg .middle } **Governance Through Play**

    ---

    Contribution → recognition → governance. 500 Tokens = 1 vote; 5,000 to propose (off‑game exchange when available).

-   :material-chart-line:{ .lg .middle } **Merit‑Based Recognition**

    ---

    Earn Points from hourly playtime and achievements across all games. No tokens are distributed in any client.

-   :material-shield-check:{ .lg .middle } **EULA‑Compliant Framework**

    ---

    Governance rights and community benefits without pay‑to‑win mechanics.

## Quick start

1. Launch your game client  
2. Add server `mc.sqware.pro` and connect  
3. Start contributing: play, help others, complete achievements  
4. Join Discord for governance and development input

---

## Compliance

No blockchain or Tokens are rewarded directly from any game clients. Recognition is Points‑only in clients. Any future Point→Token exchange would occur off‑server and outside game clients. The Token is used for governance rights and platform use only.
