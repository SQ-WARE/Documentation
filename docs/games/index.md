# SQWARE Community Platform

*Experience community ownership and merit‑based governance in action.*

---

## What this is

**This is our live community platform.** Your playtime, achievements, and community contributions earn Points that build your governance influence.

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-vote:{ .lg .middle } **Governance Through Play**

    ---

    Contribution → recognition → ownership. Tokens (like company shares) available via off‑game exchange for governance, purchases, and community support.

-   :material-chart-line:{ .lg .middle } **Merit‑Based Recognition**

    ---

    Earn Points from hourly playtime and achievements across all games. No tokens are distributed in any client.
