# Recognition System
## **Merit-Based Community Ownership**

*Translating contribution into influence*

**The SQWARE Recognition System is the foundation of our community ownership model.** Every hour you play, every achievement you earn, every contribution you make translates into SQ Tokens - your stake in the platform's governance and future development.

---

## How Recognition Works

### **Merit Over Money**

Unlike traditional gaming economies built around financial transactions, our system rewards what truly matters: **genuine contribution to the community**.

**What Counts as Contribution:**

- **Time Investment**: Active participation and engagement with the platform
- **Achievement Milestones**: Reaching significant goals and helping others achieve theirs  
- **Community Building**: Creating guides, helping new players, organizing events
- **Creative Contributions**: Building content, sharing knowledge, fostering positive culture
- **Platform Development**: Reporting bugs, providing feedback, testing new features

### **SQ Token Framework**

**SQ Tokens represent your stake in the SQWARE community** - both your past contributions and your ongoing influence over platform governance.

**Key Principles:**

- **Earned, Not Bought**: Tokens come from contribution, not financial investment
- **Governance Rights**: Tokens provide voting power on platform decisions
- **Community Ownership**: Higher token holders have greater influence over development
- **Sustainable Design**: Built for long-term community health, not speculation
