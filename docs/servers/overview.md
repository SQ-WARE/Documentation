# Minecraft Servers
## **Community Platform in Action**

*Where governance meets gameplay*

**Our Minecraft servers are the living demonstration of the SQWARE vision** - community-owned platforms where every hour played, every achievement earned, and every contribution made translates into real influence over the platform's governance and development.

- **Merit-Based Recognition**: Contribution earns SQ Tokens that provide real influence over platform decisions
- **Collaborative Development**: Community input shapes server features, rules, and development priorities  
- **Sustainable Economics**: EULA-compliant systems that reward participation without pay-to-win mechanics
- **Democratic Governance**: Players vote on server policies, resource allocation, and community standards
