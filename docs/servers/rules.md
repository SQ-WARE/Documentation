# Community Rules
## **Foundation of Community Governance**

*Guidelines that enable community ownership*

**These community guidelines form the foundation of our merit-based governance system.** They ensure a fair, safe, and welcoming environment where every community member can contribute meaningfully to our shared digital space while maintaining full compliance with Minecraft's EULA.

---

## Our Approach

**Community-Driven Standards**: These rules reflect our collective values and support the community ownership model that makes SQWARE unique.

**Merit-Based Enforcement**: Rule enforcement considers community contribution and governance participation, fostering collaborative resolution.

**EULA Compliance**: All guidelines operate within Minecraft's EULA framework, ensuring sustainable platform development.

**Evolutionary Governance**: Community members with significant recognition can participate in rule development and policy decisions.

## Core Community Values

### **Respect and Inclusion**
**Treat all community members with respect.** Our platform thrives when everyone feels welcome to contribute their unique perspectives and skills.

- **Zero Tolerance**: Hate speech, harassment, bullying, or discrimination will not be tolerated
- **Positive Environment**: Foster welcoming interactions that encourage community participation
- **Constructive Communication**: Engage in discussions that build community rather than divide it

### **Fair Play and Integrity** 
**Maintain the integrity of our community-owned platform.** Fair play ensures that recognition and governance influence reflect genuine contribution.

- **Approved Modifications Only**: Use only client-side modifications that don't provide unfair advantages
- **No Exploiting**: Report bugs rather than exploiting them - bug reporting earns recognition
- **Authentic Participation**: Earn recognition through genuine engagement, not artificial methods

### **Community Ownership Principles**
**Recognize that this platform belongs to all of us.** Your actions affect the entire community's experience and governance.

- **Shared Responsibility**: Contribute to platform improvement and community welfare
- **Collaborative Development**: Participate constructively in governance discussions and platform development
- **Long-term Thinking**: Consider the long-term health of our community in your actions

## Detailed Guidelines

### **Account and Access Management**

**Account Limits**: Maximum 3 accounts per IP address to prevent system manipulation while accommodating families.

**Ban Evasion**: Using alternate accounts to evade penalties undermines community governance and will result in extended restrictions.

**Authentication**: Maintain account security to protect both your recognition and community integrity.

### **Gameplay Integrity**

**Automation Restrictions**: No macros, auto-clickers, or scripts that automate gameplay - recognition must reflect genuine participation.

**AFK Prevention**: Extended artificial activity to farm recognition or resources is prohibited.

**Griefing Guidelines**: Griefing is allowed within server protection systems, but exploiting vulnerabilities to bypass protections is forbidden.

### **Economic and Recognition System**

**Merit-Based Earning**: Recognition and rewards must be earned through legitimate gameplay and community contribution.

**No Exploitation**: Abusing point reward systems or farming recognition without genuine participation violates community principles.

**Fair Competition**: All players must compete on equal terms - no purchased advantages that affect gameplay balance.

### **Communication and Community Standards**

**Appropriate Content**: Usernames, builds, and communications must meet community standards for inclusivity and respect.

**Constructive Engagement**: Contribute positively to community discussions and governance processes.

**Privacy Protection**: Respect other members' privacy - no sharing personal information or engaging in doxing.

### **Platform Security and Stability**

**Bug Reporting**: Report security issues and bugs through proper channels to earn recognition and protect the community.

**Infrastructure Protection**: Do not attempt to disrupt services or compromise platform security.

**Collaborative Problem-Solving**: Work with community leaders and staff to resolve issues constructively.

## EULA Compliance Framework

**Our rules operate within Minecraft's EULA requirements** while pioneering community ownership models:

### **No Gameplay Advantages for Purchase**
- Recognition provides governance rights and cosmetic benefits, never competitive advantages
- All game content remains equally accessible to all players
- Merit-based progression ensures fair competition

### **Community-Focused Benefits**
- Recognition translates to influence over community decisions, not gameplay superiority
- Governance rights reward contribution to platform development and community welfare
- Long-term community health takes precedence over individual advancement

### **Transparent Systems**
- All recognition calculations and governance processes are community-auditable
- Rule enforcement considers community input and governance participation
- Appeals process includes community representation and transparent review

---

### Minecraft Compliance and References

**Compliance Statement**: No blockchain technology or SQ Tokens are rewarded directly from Minecraft servers or clients. On Minecraft, all recognition is issued as Points via in-game systems. Points may be convertible to SQ Tokens (a governance token) in the future once available; any such conversion would occur off-server and outside the Minecraft client.
